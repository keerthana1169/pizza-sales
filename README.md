# Pizza_Sales
his project focuses on creating a comprehensive Pizza Sales Report using SQL. I analyze pizza sales data, crafting queries to gain insights into sales metrics such as popular pizza types, sales trends, and revenue generation. By leveraging SQL, I uncover valuable information to inform business decisions and optimize sales strategies.
